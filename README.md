Web development is a field that fascinates me and in which I continue to learn every day, especially the Vue.Js ecosystem. I have +2 years of professional experience in web development and I participated in many real projects.

I like to learn new things. I speak three languages: French, English and Russian. Currently, I am learning Spanish. My passion is not only to write good code but also to help people, that's why since January 2017 I started volunteering and I have a very active community life.

I am also the winner of several awards..
